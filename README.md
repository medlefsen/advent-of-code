# advent-of-code-2021

## How do?

1. Go to https://factorcode.org and download factor for your system. Just stick the factor folder somewhere (I put it in my home dir).
2. Add a `~/.factor-roots` file that just contains the path to where you checked out this repo.
3. Run factor.
4. In the inspector, type `USE: aoc.dayXX` where XX is the day to be run.
5. type `part1` for part1, `part2` for part2, and `"aoc.dayXX" test"` to run any tests it as.
